<!-- Then we are going to start learning javascript by learning how to console log with 
javascript.  Note.. currently we are placing our javascript in the body of the page, 
although in the future we will likely use an alternate document for this. 

If you place it in the body of the page we usually place it all the way at the bottom of 
the page so that the visual appearance of the page of html and css loads first, and the 
interactive components of javascript load later. -->

<script>

console.log('oh.. hello there friend');

/* now we need to open our webpage and check the console in the inspector to see the secret message */
